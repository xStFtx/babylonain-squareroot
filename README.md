# Babylonian Square Root Approximation

This Python code provides an implementation of the Babylonian (or Heron's) method for approximating the square root of a number.

## Method Description

The Babylonian method is an iterative method used to approximate the square root of a number `c`. The iterative formula is given by:

$$
x_{n+1} = \frac{1}{2} \left( x_n + \frac{c}{x_n} \right)
$$

Where \( x_{n+1} \) is the next approximation based on the current approximation \( x_n \).
